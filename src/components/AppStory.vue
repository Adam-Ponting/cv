        <p>
          Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is
          <strong>Adam</strong> and this site is a portfolio of some work I have
          done. I have had an interest in web development since the days of
          dial-up modems and have taught myself the skills I need to allow me to
          start in this industry. <br />I understand the client
          <strong>experience</strong> is central to business needs and I enjoy
          working in a team and interacting with people of different
          capabilities.
