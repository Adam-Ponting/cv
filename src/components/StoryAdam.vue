      My Story A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
      Samsa was a travelling salesman and above it there a picture that is good.
      One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
      transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like
      back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
      slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
      hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many
      legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him. wasn’t a
      dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay
      peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
      samples lay spread out on the table – Samsa was a travelling salesman.
