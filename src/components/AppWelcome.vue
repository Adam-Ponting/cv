            I have almost 20 years experience in the sports industry. The
            majority of which as a tennis coach and recently as a cycle guide
            and mechanic.
            <br />I have also worked in Europe for four years and since
            returning to England I have been working as a WorkShop Manager at
            Evans Cycles and studying the necessary skills to become a front end
            developer.

            I have studied
            <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong> and
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I have built my projects using the
            <strong>Vue</strong> framework so these are the skills I am most
            proficient in. <br />I am always learning and refining my skills and
            am excited to develop myself with each project I do and look forward
            to growing my skills in web development.
